## Description

<p align="center"> This React scoreboard application was built with reusable React elements incorporating JSX, while managing state and event handlers for added interactivity.  </p>

<p align="center"> Users are able to dynamically interact with the application using the UI components being passed down information with props. </p>

<p align="center"> Regarding UX, users enjoy an easy-to-use UI to add or subtract point values, add or delete players (with the option of creating custom names), and a stopwatch that ticks every second.  Additionally, to enhance the competitive nature amongst players, the player(s) with the greatest number of points will have a crown icon appear golden beside their name.  Both the total number of players and points are also tracked for a well-rounded, multi-purpose scoreboard application. </p>
